			<h1>Things I'm Too Tired To Say</h1>
			<h6 class=warn>Warning: most amusing when tired, most confusing when awake.</h6>
	
			I really shouldn't get up in the morning until after I've gone to bed.<br><br>
			I refuse to live on Eastern Standard Time.<br><br>
			And don't think you can trick me with that daylight savings crap.<br><br>
			I wish my snooze alarm would go off after 11 minutes instead of only 9.<br><br>
			I must be really tired, batteries are funny.<br><br>
			You can't argue with a cardboard box. The box will always win.<br><br>
			Acceleration due to gravity is also really funny if you're tired.<br><br>
			I've decided my site needs a goalie. If you would like to apply for the position please send me an email.<br><br>
			I love it when a rescue helicopter crashes and then they have to send another helicopter to save everybody.<br><br>
			Conflict delays progress.<br><br>
			Acceleration due to gravity is also very funny.<br><br>
			I may be much more insane than I was previously led to believe.<br><br>
			The human body is nothing more than an electrochemical response to stimuli.<br><br>
			The word 'buoy' is underused.<br><br>
			I would also like to hear 'zip' used a bit more often in situations that don't involve computers.<br><br>
			I'd be a lot happier if everyone on the internet would stop being so lazy and just send me a dollar.<br><br>
			Of the eight corners in my room, I am only displeased with one of them.<br><br>
			If you ever need a place to sleep, there's extra space and a blanket under my desk, only seven dollars a night.<br><br>
			I did not make up the word 'alphabetical' so you don't have to ask my permission to use it.<br><br>
