			<h1>Things I'm Too Tired To Say</h1>
			<h6 class=warn>Warning: most amusing when tired, most confusing when awake.</h6>
			<p>
				I really shouldn't get up in the morning until after I've gone to bed.
			</p>
			<p>
				I refuse to live on Eastern Standard Time.
			</p>
			<p>
				And don't think you can trick me with that daylight savings crap.
			</p>
			<p>
				I wish my snooze alarm would go off after 11 minutes instead of only 9.
			</p>
			<p>
				I must be really tired, batteries are funny.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can't argue with a cardboard box. The box will always win.
			</p>
			<p>
				Acceleration due to gravity is also really funny if you're tired.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've decided my site needs a goalie. If you would like to apply for the position please send me an email.
			</p>
			<p>
				I love it when a rescue helicopter crashes and then they have to send another helicopter to save everybody.
			</p>
			<p>
				Conflict delays progress.
			</p>
			<p>
				Acceleration due to gravity is also very funny.
			</p>
			<p>
				I may be much more insane than I was previously led to believe.
			</p>
			<p>
				The human body is nothing more than an electrochemical response to stimuli.
			</p>
			<p>
				The word 'buoy' is underused.
			</p>
			<p>
				I would also like to hear 'zip' used a bit more often in situations that don't involve computers.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'd be a lot happier if everyone on the internet would stop being so lazy and just send me a dollar.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of the eight corners in my room, I am only displeased with one of them.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you ever need a place to sleep, there's extra space and a blanket under my desk, only seven dollars a night.
			</p>
			<p>
				I did not make up the word 'alphabetical' so you don't have to ask my permission to use it.
