			<h1>The Movie Page</h1>
			
			<h2><font color="#008000">Blaise Alicki</font></h3>

			
		<p>
			So, I'm writing a movie. (Actually, I'm working on three movies now.)
		</p>
		
			<h2><font color="#0000FF">The Concept</font></h3>
			
		<p>
			The original idea is a life without consequences for the first movie.
		</p>
		
			<h2><font color="#0000FF">That's A Terrible Idea</font></h3>
			
		<p>
			I don't care.
		</p>
		
			<h2><font color="#0000FF">Wogga?</font></h3>
			
		<p>
			Wogga wogga.
		</p>
		
			<h2><font color="#0000FF">So, Is That It?</font></h3>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			No, but that's all I'm disclosing publicly at this time. If you want more, you'll have to pay me for it. I have some story boards for a few shots and a couple of scenes worked out and my main characters have been fleshed out a bit. Other than that, I have no idea for an actual story to take place during the movie.
		</p>
		
			<h2><font color="#0000FF">And The Second Movie?</font></h3>
			
		<p>
			I had this whole story about some witness protection thing and evil lawyers, but I'm not sure I want to make that one any more right now.
		</p>
		
			<h2><font color="#0000FF">Alright, What About The Third Movie?</font></h3>
			
		<p>
			It's supposed to be a funny movie about Ninjas. This one actually has some pieces of a script done. <a href="ninjah-fantasy.html">Click here</a> to see what I've written so far.
