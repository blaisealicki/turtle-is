			<h1>The Movie Page</h1>			
			<h2 class="blaise">Blaise Alicki</h2>			
			<p>
				So, I'm writing a movie. (Actually, I'm working on three movies now.)
			</p>		
			<h2 class="label">The Concept</h2>			
			<p>
				The original idea is a life without consequences for the first movie.
			</p>		
			<h2 class="label">That's A Terrible Idea</h2>			
			<p>
				I don't care.
			</p>		
			<h2 class="label">Wogga?</h2>			
			<p>
				Wogga wogga.
			</p>		
			<h2 class="label">So, Is That It?</h2>		
			<p>
				No, but that's all I'm disclosing publicly at this time. If you want more, you'll have to pay me for it. I have some story boards for a few shots and a couple of scenes worked out and my main characters have been fleshed out a bit. Other than that, I have no idea for an actual story to take place during the movie.
			</p>		
			<h2 class="label">And The Second Movie?</h2>			
			<p>
				I had this whole story about some witness protection thing and evil lawyers, but I'm not sure I want to make that one any more right now.
			</p>		
			<h2 class="label">Alright, What About The Third Movie?</h2>			
			<p>
				It's supposed to be a funny movie about Ninjas. This one actually has some pieces of a script done. <a href="ninjah-fantasy.html">Click here</a> to see what I've written so far.
