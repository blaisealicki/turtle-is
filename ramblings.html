			Saw Reign of Fire a day or two ago.&nbsp; I've decided it is neither a good nor a bad movie, but it is most certainly a movie.&nbsp; Starburst may have created the worlds greatest commercial.&nbsp; Its the one where a girl on a couch unwraps a Starburst in her mouth.&nbsp; Going to the dentist today.&nbsp; I'm over 48 hours into Tactics Ogre, it's taking forever to beat.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Neverwinter Nights is going unplayed and Eternal Darkness and Warcraft 3 are unpurchased.

			I remain cavity-free.&nbsp; Got Eternal Darkness.&nbsp; I have a feeling that I will never beat the game as I barely made it through the first level.&nbsp; I suck at video games.&nbsp; And yet I own over a hundred of them (including computer games and ROMs.)&nbsp; I'm also eagerly awaiting the upcoming release of Mario Sunshine and am very jealous of the Japanese people who are playing the game right now.&nbsp; Austin Powers opens Friday, the newest commercial seems to be the funniest one so far.&nbsp; Hopefully I don't have to work Friday so I can see it opening day.

			Saw Austin Powers.&nbsp; It drags in a few spots and gets a little weird at the end, but overall it is very funny and definitely worth seeing.&nbsp; Came home to a black out.&nbsp; Fortunately my glow-in-the-dark Gameboy had charged batteries so I was able to play Tactics Ogre until the power came on an hour later.
