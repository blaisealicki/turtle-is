        errors go away on their own. I have a theory that errors have a genuine dislike for my dull computer
        and will leave out of sheer boredom. Perhaps I should take the next twenty minutes and find the
        formula for how long I will have to wait for the errors to all leave.

        So, here I sit with 652 errors. Not bad for an hour and nine minutes worth of work.
        Now if I could only figure out what the program will do when it has no errors...

        actually dialed up errors on other computers in the area and invited them to my computer to enjoy the shows since my computer has such a good
        view of the TV. Once the news came though, all the foreign errors started to yawn and look at the
        system time and said “Well, its late and we should be getting back,” or “I'd love to stay, but the misses has a headache.”
        So, the current error count is 653. Apparently, one of the errors that stopped over got a little drunk and passed out.

        the program. On the upside, my errors seem to have become intelligent. If I can figure out how then my little project will be a complete success.
