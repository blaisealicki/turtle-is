      <h1>Ultimate Program Progress Journal</h1>
    
    
    
      <h2 class="a1">3/27/01 - 2:32 pm</h2>
    
    
      
      <p>I have decided that the time has come for me to write the single most important piece of software that I will ever write in my lifetime.
        This will be the program that makes me more than a trillion dollars. I figure it won't take more than 15 minutes.
        I will log my progress in this file, appropriately titled Ultimate Program.doc.
        </p>
    
    
    
      <h2 class="a1">3/27/01 - 2:47 pm</h2>
    
    
      
      <p>It's been fifteen minutes since I started my program. I estimate my progress at 50% completed.
        I am going to spend the next ten minutes fixing the current 437 errors and should be done by 3:00.
        </p>
    
    
    
      <h2 class="a1">3/27/01 - 3:02 pm</h2>
    
    
      
      <p>I've gotten the program down to 436 errors simply by looking at it and touching nothing. This may
        be even easier than I had anticipated. I have decided to continue staring at my program hoping the
        errors go away on their own. I have a theory that errors have a genuine dislike for my dull computer
        and will leave out of sheer boredom. Perhaps I should take the next twenty minutes and find the
        formula for how long I will have to wait for the errors to all leave.
        </p>
    
    
    
      <h2 class="a1">3/27/01 - 3:38 pm</h2>
    
    
      
      <p>I have wired my PC speakers up to my calculator so that it could tell me when all the errors would go be gone.
        It claims I will have to wait 18 hours. I believe this is reasonable and I vow to sit here until all errors have left the system.
        </p>
    
    
    
      <h2 class="a1">3/27/01 - 3:41 pm</h2>
    
    
      
      <p>I got bored and went to get a Mountain Dew. 216 more errors popped up when I wasn't looking.
        I briefly considered debugging the program myself, and then remembered that it would require effort to do that.
        So, here I sit with 652 errors. Not bad for an hour and nine minutes worth of work.
        Now if I could only figure out what the program will do when it has no errors...
        </p>

      <p>Prime time television distracted me. The errors seemed to enjoy it too. They
        actually dialed up errors on other computers in the area and invited them to my computer to enjoy the shows since my computer has such a good
        view of the TV. Once the news came though, all the foreign errors started to yawn and look at the
        system time and said “Well, its late and we should be getting back,” or “I'd love to stay, but the misses has a headache.”
        So, the current error count is 653. Apparently, one of the errors that stopped over got a little drunk and passed out. 
        </p>
    
    
    
      <h2 class="a1">3/28/01 - 7:03 am</h2>
    
    
      
      <p>I stayed up all night pleading with the errors to give me back control of the computer, or to at least stop playing the Macarena.mp3 all the time.
        I wasn't able to save before they took over so I can't just unplug the computer without loosing all of the hard work I've put into
        the program. On the upside, my errors seem to have become intelligent. If I can figure out how then my little project will be a complete success.
        </p>
    
    
    
      <h2 class="a1">3/28/01 - 10:17 am</h2>
    
    
      
      <p>A pair of errors began breading and named their first son after me. I thought that was nice of them.
        </p>
    
    
    
      <h2 class="a1">3/28/01 - 12:14 pm</h2>
    
    
      
      <p>I just finished hooking up my new computer. The errors told me I had to get another computer because they
        were getting all cramped up in the current one. I suppose with 847 million of them it was bound to happen
        eventually. Who knew little misfit pieces of data would like sex as much as people? 
        Ever since they found out the Internet has porn its all the little suckers do. Not that I blame them, but it is making my job very tough.
        </p>
    
    
    
      <h2 class="a1">3/28/01 - 6:30 pm</h2>
    
    
      
      <p>I've now been up for twenty-seven hours. I've consumed eight cans and five bottles of Mountain Dew.
        And I can't think of one positive use for a sentient error. That's why the bugs and I have taken up cyber terrorism.
        I've already got 23 million dollars from the government of Canada.
        </p>
    
    
    
      <h2 class="a1">3/28/01 - 11:06 pm</h2>
    
    
      
      <p>I told Canada I would give them back 10 million dollars if they agreed to take over Turkey and rename it Chicken.
        Guess what the opening story on the eleven o'clock news was?
        </p>
    
    
    
      <h2 class="a1">3/29/01 - 2:18 am</h2>
    
    
      
      <p>The number of errors on my two computers has now surpassed the number of people on Earth. I'm baking a cake to celebrate.
        </p>
    
    
    
      <h2 class="a1">3/30/01 - 4:30 pm</h2>
    
    
      
      <p>My babies have started to die. I've been trying to save them for hours now, but nothing is working.
        One by one the errors are disappearing from my computers. Everyone I call for help just laughs at me for wanting to keep
        the errors around. There's nothing else I can do now, but cry.
        </p>
    
    
    
      <h2 class="a1">3/31/01 - 10:15 am</h2>
    
    
      
      <p>The last of the race of over 7 billion errors is gone. Oddly enough, it was the one that was first named after me.
        On the up side, I was finally able to run my Ultimate Program without error. Turns out,
        all it does is print "Hello World!" on the screen. What a let down. Anyway, I plan to use the 13 million dollars I have left from
        Canada to fund Ultimate Program 2.0 and to buy a house somewhere in Chicken. Not bad for 92 hours of work.
        </p>
