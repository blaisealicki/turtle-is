<p><h2>Nin-Jah Fantasy</h2></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the future of a long time ago (i.e. right now) there is 
a gang of Nin-Jah traveling the country in search of something. And then they 
found something, but discovered it was not what they were looking for, so they 
put it back and continued their search. Suddenly they found what they were 
looking for, but one of them dropped it and it broke. So now, their search 
continues.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">SHIN: What the hell is your 
problem, WANG?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">WANG: I thought I saw something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">SHIN: There's nothing here but 
your shadow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">WANG: ...I have a really scary 
shadow...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">SHIN: Keep moving and shut up.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">TOE: You're an idiot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">TOE: Damn it, NEE, you hit me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">NEE: Hit you with a <i>CART</i>!</p>
