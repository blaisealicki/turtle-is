			Maybe it will work, maybe it can't, I don't know, I'm just putting it out there. A virus is specialized at killing cells. The protein coating of a virus tells the virus what kind of cells to go after and infect. If the coating could be changed so that a virus could attack a specific type of cancer cell then a patient could get an injection similar to a flu shot that would destroy only the cancer and leave the healthy cells.
