			Maybe it will work, maybe it can't, I don't know, I'm just putting it out there. A virus is specialized at killing cells. The protein coating of a virus tells the virus what kind of cells to go after and infect. If the coating could be changed so that a virus could attack a specific type of cancer cell then a patient could get an injection similar to a flu shot that would destroy only the cancer and leave the healthy cells.

			You get some brownie mix, throw in some mini marshmallows and some Golden Grahams cereal, bake and enjoy. I've never actually tried it, so this may not be brilliant in practive, but it seems like a good idea.

			It would habe to be run locally, and be more like pizza delivery, but the orders would come in over the internet rather than by phone. The site would list the most commonly requested items to allow for easy ordering and the people taking the orders would then go to the store, pick up the items and deliver them for a small fee.
