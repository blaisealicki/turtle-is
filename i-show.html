			<h1>The i-Show Page</h1>
			
			<h2><font color="#0000FF">What's an i-Show?</font></h2>
			
			<p>
				I had this idea for a show. Something new, different, and exactly what you've seen before. It's supposed to be like a late night talk show without the guests (because who is going to come to Michigan to be on some crappy internet show?) So I do some comedy bits for about twenty minutes a few times a week and see if I can get a cult following... AND THEN I TAKE OVER THE WORLD!!! (Insert evil laugh here.) I'm currently still in the development stages of the show. I'm trying to get enough material for a few weeks worth of shows and I still need a decent video camera. Plus, I'll need better internet hosting.

				The creator, writer, director, and host of the i-Show, <font color="#008000"> Blaise</font> does it all. Why? For you. Because he cares.

			<h2><font color="#FF00FF">Eddie da Pig</font></h2>
			
			<p>
				<font color="#FF00FF">Eddie da Pig</font> gives us the word of the day. Unfortunately, Eddie is not a talking pig so the word of the day is &quot;OINK!&quot;<p><img src="images/eddiedapig.gif"></p>

			<h2><font color="#0000FF">Will The i-Show have nudity?</font></h2>

				Only <font color="#FF00FF">da Pig</font> will be appearing naked.
