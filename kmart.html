			Lets establish some good rules to make things easier for all of us:
			<ol>
				<li>If your car has a working alarm, you should not be shopping at <font color="#FF0000">K</font><font color="#0000FF">mart</font>. You can afford better.</li>
				<li>You are not the center of the universe. If you want me to help you, wait until I'm finished helping the customer I am with.</li>
				<li>If you aren't going to listen to what I have to say, then please don't ask me any questions. If I say there are none in the back, don't expect me to go look just to make you feel better. I just checked ten minutes ago for the last person who asked for the same thing.</li>
				<li>The bathroom has NEVER moved. Do you understand the amount of work that would be involved in moving plumbing around a building? We don't have that kind of money. Feel free to check the same corner of the store the bathroom has always been in before asking where it is.</li>
				<li>Everyone gets the same ad as you. Just because I don't have a product in stock when you get to the store doesn't necessarily mean I didn't have any. I have a hard time feeling sorry for someone who waits until an hour before we close on Saturday to come in looking for ad merchandise.</li>
				<li>The ad is printed nationally and most ordering is controlled above the store level. As a store we have no control over what is in the ad and little control over how much ad merchandise we have on hand. Is it stupid? Yes, its the <font color="#FF0000">K</font><font color="#0000FF">mart</font> way. Get over it.</li>
				<li>If you're going to buy patio furniture, please drive a truck to the store. Not an SUV, not a minivan, A TRUCK. Patio furniture comes in big boxes.</li>
				<li>If I'm in the store and I'm wearing a red vest and a name tag don't ask me if I work at the store unless you expect a smart-ass answer.</li>
			</ol>
