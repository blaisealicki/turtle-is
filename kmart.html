			Update: Air conditioning seems to be working at the moment. Very bizarre.<br><br>
			Update 2: Only one air conditioner was actually fixed. Not surprising.<br><br>
			Update 3: Most recent attempt to fix AC appears to have work. AND, this is big so sit down, THE BREAK ROOM HAS AIR CONDITIONING!!!

			Lets establish some good rules to make things easier for all of us:
			<ol>
				<li>If your car has a working alarm, you should not be shopping at <font color="#FF0000">K</font><font color="#0000FF">mart</font>. You can afford better.</li>
				<li>You are not the center of the universe. If you want me to help you, wait until I'm finished helping the customer I am with.</li>
				<li>If you aren't going to listen to what I have to say, then please don't ask me any questions. If I say there are none in the back, don't expect me to go look just to make you feel better. I just checked ten minutes ago for the last person who asked for the same thing.</li>
				<li>The bathroom has NEVER moved. Do you understand the amount of work that would be involved in moving plumbing around a building? We don't have that kind of money. Feel free to check the same corner of the store the bathroom has always been in before asking where it is.</li>
				<li>Everyone gets the same ad as you. Just because I don't have a product in stock when you get to the store doesn't necessarily mean I didn't have any. I have a hard time feeling sorry for someone who waits until an hour before we close on Saturday to come in looking for ad merchandise.</li>
				<li>The ad is printed nationally and most ordering is controlled above the store level. As a store we have no control over what is in the ad and little control over how much ad merchandise we have on hand. Is it stupid? Yes, its the <font color="#FF0000">K</font><font color="#0000FF">mart</font> way. Get over it.</li>
				<li>If you're going to buy patio furniture, please drive a truck to the store. Not an SUV, not a minivan, A TRUCK. Patio furniture comes in big boxes.</li>
				<li>If I'm in the store and I'm wearing a red vest and a name tag don't ask me if I work at the store unless you expect a smart-ass answer.</li>
			</ol>
