			<h1>My <span class="warn">Complaints</span> About <span class="k">K</span><span class="mart">mart</span></h1>
			<h2 class="label">There is no ad merchandise</h2>			
			<p>
				Don't you just love going to a store that doesn't have anything to sell. We ran out of air conditioners after the first three hours of a three day sale.
			</p>		
			<h2 class="label">Rainchecks are stupid</h2>
			<p>
				I went to the store to get buy something, but instead I got a stupid piece of paper. Oh joy! now I can wipe my ass.
			</p>		
			<h2 class="label">The corporate office is run by monkeys</h2>			
			<p>
				Not super-intelligent, genetically engineered monkeys either. No, they are a bunch of drunken, stupid-ass monkeys that get off by throwing shit at each other.
			</p>
			<h2 class="label">Everyday the prices change</h2>
			<p>
				Up and down and up and down the prices just keep moving.
			</p>
			<h2 class="label">Somebody stole Layaway Jones</h2>
			<p>
				And he hasn't been seen since.
			</p>
			<h2 class="label">Fewer than half the air conditioners in the store are working</h2>
			<p>
				It is the hottest store in West Michigan. When its 85 degrees outside, its 82 degrees inside. That's why I'm trying
				to start a water gun fight in the store. So if you stop in please bring a loaded squirt gun.
			</p>
			<p>
				Update: Air conditioning seems to be working at the moment. Very bizarre.
			</p>
			<p>
				Update 2: Only one air conditioner was actually fixed. Not surprising.
			</p>
			<p>
				Update 3: Most recent attempt to fix AC appears to have work. AND, this is big so sit down, THE BREAK ROOM HAS AIR CONDITIONING!!!
			</p>

			<p>
				I don't think I have to elaborate.

			<h2 class="label"><span class="k">K</span>mart hates America</h2>
			<p>
				I had to work eight hours on the Fourth of July because <span class="k">K</span><span class="mart">mart</span>
				is open. I also get to work on Labor Day and Memorial Day, because <span class="k">K</span><span class="mart">mart</span> is open
				on those days too. Clearly, <span class="k">K</span><span class="mart">mart</span> hates America.
			</p>
			<p>
				Update: I somehow got out of working on Memorial Day, but Kmart was still open, so I stand by my statement: Kmart Hates America.
			</p>
			<h2 class="label">A good number of customers are dumb as bricks</h2>
			<p>
				Lets establish some good rules to make things easier for all of us:
				<ol>
					<li>If your car has a working alarm, you should not be shopping at <span class="k">K</span><span class="mart">mart</span>. You can afford better.</li>
					<li>You are not the center of the universe. If you want me to help you, wait until I'm finished helping the customer I am with.</li>
					<li>If you aren't going to listen to what I have to say, then please don't ask me any questions. If I say there are none in the back, don't expect me to go look just to make you feel better. I just checked ten minutes ago for the last person who asked for the same thing.</li>
					<li>The bathroom has NEVER moved. Do you understand the amount of work that would be involved in moving plumbing around a building? We don't have that kind of money. Feel free to check the same corner of the store the bathroom has always been in before asking where it is.</li>
					<li>Everyone gets the same ad as you. Just because I don't have a product in stock when you get to the store doesn't necessarily mean I didn't have any. I have a hard time feeling sorry for someone who waits until an hour before we close on Saturday to come in looking for ad merchandise.</li>
					<li>The ad is printed nationally and most ordering is controlled above the store level. As a store we have no control over what is in the ad and little control over how much ad merchandise we have on hand. Is it stupid? Yes, its the <span class="k">K</span><span class="mart">mart</span> way. Get over it.</li>
					<li>If you're going to buy patio furniture, please drive a truck to the store. Not an SUV, not a minivan, A TRUCK. Patio furniture comes in big boxes.</li>
					<li>If I'm in the store and I'm wearing a red vest and a name tag don't ask me if I work at the store unless you expect a smart-ass answer.</li>
				</ol>

			<h2 class="label">I work at <span class="k">K</span>mart</h2>
			<p>
				Maybe you didn't understand... <span class="blaise">I</span> WORK AT <span class="k">K</span><span class="mart">MART</span>!!!
			</p>
			<p>
				Update: Okay, I don't actually work at Kmart anymore, but it still sucks.
			</p>
			<p>
				Update 2: Welp, <span class="k">K</span><span class="mart">mart</span> has basically gone out of business, so I guess I win.
